# Method of False Position using Python

## History
Method of False Position is also known as Regula Falsi. The simple false position technique is found in:
1. Cuneiform tablets from ancient Babylonian mathematics
2. Papyri from ancient Egyptian mathematics

## Problem
Solving for one root (or more provided it exist in another given interval) of a given equation at a time.

## Objective
Using Method of False Position in order to approximate the value of a root in an equation at a time.

## Previous Knowledge
Some prior methematical knowledge would be helpful when using Method of False Position which are: 
1. Coordinate Geometry (Equation of Straight Line, Gradient)
2. Rearrangement of the derived equation to make 𝑥 (𝑜𝑟 𝑐) as subject
